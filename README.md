We are interested in creating a multiple regression model to predict the performance of running backs and wide receivers in the NFL using their data from the scouting combine.

Our main research question is: What is the predictive value of NFL scouting combine data on the future performance of running backs and wide receivers? We can make this question more specific by asking: Which, if any, of the metrics taken during the NFL scouting combine are indicative of the future performance of running backs and wide receivers? We can measure future performance in the first three years of these players in the NFL while also looking at the entirety of their careers. Further, if enough data is available we could look at whether some NFL teams are better at scouting in the combine than others.

Our question is motivated by research done in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research (https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2016/05000/Predictive_Value_of_National_Football_League.25.aspx), which concluded that the metrics taken for players during the combine have some value for predicting the future performance of running backs and wide receivers in the NFL. This research only used one dependent variable to represent the performance of running backs and wide receivers. We believe that there could be other statistics that could also be representative of player performance that we could work with. Thus, we will work with multiple linear regression and aim to create one or more models that could potentially predict future performance based on combine data.

We plan on obtaining performance data on running backs and wide receivers through Pro Football Reference (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) which allows you to create tables of data and export those tables in a csv file. We plan on obtaining data from past NFL combines through a dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitchellweg1/nfl-combine-results-dataset-2000-2022) which has all of the combine data from 2000-2022.
